# .net-project-

This project is an exercise in both file I/O and validating user input and using string manipulation to edit and reformat input into a preferred format.  Some fields have patterns, some expect numeric values â€¦ possibly with limits.  Some fields are required (and cannot be just spaces), some are optional or conditionally optional, some will cause abends if null is not expected.  Some strings need to be trimmed of leading and trailing blanks, shifted to upper- or lower-case or capitalized
